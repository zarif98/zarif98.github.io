        <h1>My Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            Describing my art school portfolio as a chaotic hot mess would be an understatement. Since I began painting when I was 8 years old finding my best work usually meant an unsurmountable challenge. I only had two weeks to create my portfolio and I don't think I have ever worked as hard as I did to finish this website. That being said, those were two of my favorite weeks in my winter break. I drew everything and anything that inspired me, completely dedicated myself to produce something everyday or every week, and tackled so many different types of mediums and problems. I tried some after school art studios but because I felt restricted by their methods, I ended up preparing most of my art school portfolio completely by my own taste and standards. Looking back now, it’s funny to see what I thought was cool and how that drive to tackle anything still lingers in my art and creative process. My mishmash of Van Gogh's art style and my own bright colorwork is what I think sets me apart from other candidates. If you have any ideas or challenges, please send me an <a href="*"> email</a>.
